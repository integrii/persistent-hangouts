# Persistent Hangouts
This chrome extension enables persistent hangouts by automatically clicking prompts.  Thats it.

Use this extension on a chromebook or any other system that can run Chrome with a [static hangouts url](http://www.gregarnette.com/blog/2013/12/how-to-simple-persistent-google-hangout-virtual-conference-rooms/) to create a telepresence video chat portal on the cheap.

Setup the chromebook in [Kiosk mode](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3134673?hl=en) with this extension ID (jijmekelidiehnmkiaegmpkpgcceniam) to ensure it will reboot back into the persistent hangout automatically.  

Install in the Chrome web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jijmekelidiehnmkiaegmpkpgcceniam/publish-delayed).
