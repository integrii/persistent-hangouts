# Persistent Hangouts
This chrome extension enables persistent hangouts by automatically clicking prompts.  Thats it.

Use this extension on a chromebook with a [static hangouts url](http://www.gregarnette.com/blog/2013/12/how-to-simple-persistent-google-hangout-virtual-conference-rooms/) to create a telepresence video chat portal on the cheap.

Setup the chromebook in Kiosk mode with this extension ID to ensure it will reboot back into the persistent hangout automatically.
